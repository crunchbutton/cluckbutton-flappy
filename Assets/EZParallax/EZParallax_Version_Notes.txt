V1.1.3 - 3/4/2013
----------
Retracted the submission from the store yet again to make the starting experience a bit more user friendly.

Fixes:
-- Tag names do not have default text anymore. Those were misleading, as they made it look like the tags were actually created, when in fact they were not.
-- Warnings now appear if the user tries to initialize EZP without a camera or player set. EZP will abort initialization after warning.
-- Fixed some code that was assuming the user would be using at least one infinitely wrapping object... assumptions are bad.


V1.1.2 - 3/4/2013
----------
Noticed some last minute things that needed to be fixed/added before v1.1.1 went live on the store.

Fixes:
-- Got rid of occasional blinking sprite edges
-- Added buttons to add and remove parallax elements to the parallax list in the inspector, so that users don't accidentally wipe out their entire parallax list when changing the total size
--Fixed a miscaled element in the demo sene

V1.1.1 - 3/4/2013
----------
Some minor tweaks to the code.

Fixes:
-- Random "house cleaning" fixes that I missed the first time through

V1.1 - 3/4/2013
----------
Complete overhaul of the system to enable customizable properties on each parallaxing element. Added many new features.

-- Tag system
